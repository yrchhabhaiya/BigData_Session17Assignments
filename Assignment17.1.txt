1. What is NoSQL data base?
Answer: A NoSQL (originally referring to "non SQL", "non relational" or "not only SQL")[1] database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
Features of NoSQL:
Generic data model
• Heterogeneous containers, including sets, maps, and arrays

Dynamic type discovery and conversion
• NoSQL analytics systems support runtime type identification and conversion so that custom business logic can be used to dictate analytic treatment of variation.

Non-relational and De-normalised
• Data is stored in single tables as compared to joining multiple tables.

Commodity hardware
• Adding more of the economical servers allows NoSQL databases to scale to handle more data.

Highly distributable
• Distributed databases can store and process a set of information on more than one device.


2. How does data get stored in NoSQl database?
	Document Oriented Databases (MongoDB): Stores documents as a data and allows indexing of documents on the basis of not only its primary identifier but also its properties
	Graph Based Databases (Neo4j): A graph database uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
	Column Based Databases (HBase): The column-oriented storage allows data to be stored effectively. It avoids consuming space when storing nulls by simply not storing a column when a value doesn’t exist for that column.
	Key Value Databases (Membase): The key of a key/value pair is a unique value in the set and can be easily looked up to access the data.


3. What is a column family in HBase?
	Collection of columns having multiple actual columns inside.

4. How many maximum number of columns can be added to HBase table?
	There is no hard limit to number of columns in HBase , we can have more than 1 million columns but usually three column families are recommended ( not more than three).

5. Why columns are not defined at the time of table creation in HBase?
	Column families are defined rather than defining columns since columns are dynamic in HBase, which can be different for each records.

6. How does data get managed in HBase?
	• Region servers serve data for reads and writes.
	• HBase Master process handles the Region assignment, DDL (create, delete tables) operations
	• Zookeeper maintains a live cluster state.


7. What happens internally when new data gets inserted into HBase table?
	• HBase Tables are divided horizontally by row key range into “Regions.”
	• A region contains all rows in the table between the region’s start key and end key.
	• Regions are assigned to the nodes in the cluster, called “Region Servers,” and these serve
data for reads and writes.
	• A region server can serve about 1,000 regions.
